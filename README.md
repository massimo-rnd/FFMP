## üöÄ Overview

A multithreaded C# CLI for digital media processing using FFMPEG. Transcode as many files in parallel as your system can handle.

## üéØ Features

- Processing Multiple video files at once
- As many concurrent processes as your system can handle

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Requirements
- .NET 8.0 Runtime

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/massimo-rnd/FFMP/releases/latest) page and Download the latest Version for your OS
2. Open a Terminal/CMD Window

## üíª Usage

FFMP's usage is almost identical to FFMPEG, consider this simple example:

```bash
dotnet path/to/FFMP.dll --codec libx265 --preset fast -d "/path/to/input/files" --output-pattern "/path/to/output/files/{{name}}_compressed{{ext}}" --threads 2
```
Using FFMP for a single file doesn't really make sense. Use this tool if you have a folder of videos you want to process.

You can adjust your codec by using any codec that is installed on your system behind the `--codec` parameter. Same goes for the preset in `--preset`.

If you want to see all of FFMPEGs output, just use the `--verbose` flag.

For more info on the -o syntax, run ffzap --help. For more ffmpeg options, visit [ffmpeg's documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html).
